This project performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset and visualizes the first three principal components in a 3D scatter plot. It also includes a Seaborn pairplot for quick exploratory analysis. The 3D plot colors points by species and can include a legend and cleaner styling.


Why PCA here
PCA reduces the original 4D measurements to 3D while preserving most variance, making species patterns easier to see in a 3D plot.
